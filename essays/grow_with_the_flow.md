### Programming the Programmer

Prior to having a formal introduction to programming languages, all I knew of writing code were the things we could tinker with on 
personal blogging websites and by sticking generated code, that I didn’t understand, into text boxes on mySpace to personalize a profile during the earlier days of social media. Coming from a generation where computer classes were the least popular extra-curricular class rather than a part of the core-curriculum of courses, learning to code has been challenging, and is yet rewarding in a different way than what I image it would have been if it were a part of the usual course of studies during my teen years. When thinking about my experience thus far, I realize that it has challenged me to rewire my logic into performing sequences of executable code contained in curly brackets. Conceptually, and with practice, things do make sense. And as my knowledge progresses, I better understand the functionality of format and syntax. Ultimately providing a sense of satisfaction and excitement in having found a new form of creativity.

The first two programming languages I have learned were within the first two years of college. Programming with Java, and C/C++ in a class setting offered much of the fundamental groundwork. Yet it wasn't until starting to learn JavaScript, this current semester, that I am feeling more optimistic about programming. Perhaps because certain logic is familiar, and I know a bit more of what can be expected. Aside from the new syntax, it appears that with JavaScript I’ve entered the era after having learned some of the rules, to now learning how to break them a little to have some fun. That is, to an extent because I know this experience is really just getting started. Compared to the previous languages I’ve learned. JavaScript seems to simplify the coding experience with writing functions as first class objects, having variables that can take more than one data type, and allowing flexibility by how we can approach and design code with ES6.

### Practice makes you better than yesterday

Coming into this semester with having just made the turn before hitting the rapids, my thoughts on athletic software engineering is that it is meant to be an active and engaging experience. This style of learning appears to be stressful, yet there is something to appreciate about its demand. Athletic software engineering requires one to stay conncurrent with the course, and places me outside of a comfort zone. Keeping me from feeling complacent, or becoming stagnant with course material and learning. Therefore, self-discipline is necessary for there to be any hope of staying with the pace, and being successful at the end of this term. There is much to gain, and I am coming to realize that ICS 314 may be the most important course I take within the computer science program at UH Manoa. Because of the academic and personal challenges the method of athletic software engineering, and this course curriculum presents.

The” workout of the day” (WODs) are weekly challenges that put our skills, and comprehension to the test. Either in a group, or individually, these exercises are meant to prepare us for scenarios that require quick thinking, and the ability to collaborate with our peers in doing group WODs. Although intimidating to know that there are many exercises ahead within this semester. These are essentially mini game-days that are meant to challenge our effort, and prepare us for the larger challenges that may come across our work desk. The effectiveness of this style of learning is recognizable. Though we haven’t quite gotten the full experience of it yet. I can see how it can be beneficial, given that we take our experiences and opportunities seriously.
