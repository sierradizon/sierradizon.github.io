## Project: UH Lost and Found

Authors: Victor, Jalen, Eisen, Michelle, Sierra

## Overview:
The problem: 
There isnâ€™t a unified location for lost, and found items on campus.

The solution: 
UH accessible website to post lost and found items on campus. Students can identify their items, then contact the department to request pick up.

Mockup page ideas:
- Landing page
- Create user page, login page, delete user page
- Admin home page
- Lost items page, edit items, remove item
- Found items page, edit items, remove item
- Status if claimed or not claimed
- Category search list
- Inbox page

Use case ideas:
- Student goes to landing page, checks out lost items page, contacts listed admin who has the item to claim the item, admin updates the item on the website
- Admin receives a lost item, logs in to account, posts it on the website as found item
- Lost items can be organized by categories such as clothes, electronic devices, or personal belongings
- Inbox contains notifications if someone has found your lost item, or similar found items was found recently

Beyond the basics:
- Sign-up page (filter @hawaii.edu)
- Documentation
