## Project: UH Lost and Found

Authors: Victor, Jalen, Eisen, Michelle, Sierra

## Overview:
The problem: 
When an item goes missing on the UH campus, it can prove challenging to track down its whereabouts, given that each department or building maintains its own "lost and found" repository. Recognizing that lost items may stray far from their initial point of loss, establishing a centralized system for campus-wide lost and found services enhances communication and increases the chances of item recovery for students. This initiative aims to minimize losses and prevent the accumulation of unclaimed items within individual departments.

The solution: 
The UH Lost and Found application offers registered students a seamless experience to reclaim their lost items. By logging in, students gain access to a comprehensive database where they can swiftly search for their belongings. Moreover, the user interface allows students to post details about their lost items on a forum, ensuring thorough coverage in case an item hasn't yet been turned in to a department. Department administrators possess the capability to upload found items onto a dedicated page, facilitating students in locating their missing possessions. Registered UH students can effortlessly navigate the platform, identify their items, and coordinate with the respective department for retrieval.

Page Ideas:
- Landing page
- User page
- Admin home page
- Lost items page
- Found items page

Use case ideas:
- Student goes to landing page, checks out lost items page, contacts listed admin who has the item to claim the item, admin updates the item on the website
- Admin receives a lost item, logs in to account, posts it on the website as found item
- Lost items can be organized by categories such as clothes, electronic devices, or personal belongings
- Inbox contains notifications if someone has found your lost item, or similar found items was found recently

Beyond the basics:
- Sign-up page
- Documentation
