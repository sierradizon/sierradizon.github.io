## Principle -- resources

Five months ago I would have not been able to tell you about more than half of what I know now. That being most of the topics we learned throughout the semester, upon the experiences and projects within the course which taught me a great deal about User Interface Frameworks, and Design Patterns. Working to design, and build web applications for class work introduced these fundamentals. Yet these efficient tools and practices find residence in software engineering.

## Function and Style

Metaphorically speaking, in a world where information is received in countries far from one another, the collaboration of information would at some point find it helpful to have a way for there to be successful communication with each other. Leading me to the thought that UI frameworks perform in such a way to funnel perspectives across platforms and coding languages. Basically streamlining the development process. Libraries and design elements are some of the components of UI frameworks that enhance consistency across projects.

Along with UI frameworks that offer reusable practices are design patterns. Design patterns are solutions to common programming challenges. Familiarizing myself with design patterns provides some comfort in seeing things from a new perspective. And like other topics, design patterns were developed to support comprehensive work for a wide-scale of information in the network of programming. Outside of developing web applications, these fundamentals are resources for collaborative and strategic design.
