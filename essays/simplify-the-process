## Standards for Consistency

Practice and implication of coding standards are helpful in unifying code characteristics and style. At first it would appear overwhelming to learn alongside a new programming language. I find that having such coding guidelines to programming style is helpful in developing smoother code for other programmers to understand, and also in some way makes learning less complicated. I think that is because it eliminates some of the guess work in deciding how to structure the program. Because sometimes even that gets overwhelming especially when developing a program can often take numerous lines of code. 

## Making it Work, and Getting it Done

Since beginning to use ESLint and IntelliJ this past week, I can honestly say that having ESLint as a quality assurance tool has been helpful in creating consistency and readability. Having the green check mark appear when there are no more errors also feels nice. It's like a little a-okay to move ahead, which again makes it clear to understand error solutions. Further assisting to anticipate future issues because of an established coding standard. IntelliJ seems to be intuitive which is also helpful in providing solutions to expedite the writing process. Iâ€™m sure as we practice and continue to utilize ESLint as well as IntelliJ that there is more to discover in how these tools can be even more effective.
