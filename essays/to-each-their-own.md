 ## Tomato, Tomat-oe

My most recent experience is also the first introduction I have had to any UI Frameworks as well as HTML and CSS. Using Bootstrap within our course material has not been the most daunting experience (as anticipated) when learning a new programming language, compared to how I feel about learning the syntax of JavaScript. Perhaps this is a case of to-each-their-own, and so in my opinion I found this section of the semester to be rewarding because of the ability to see our production on a webpage. Seeming more tangible (or fun to see) than “hello world” or the sum of two products printed on a terminal screen. I realize that there is more to the experience that I am not aware of, and that being able to produce more with other programming languages is possible. However, this section of learning UI basics and frameworks has been the most satisfying part of what we are learning this semester in ICS 314.

## Standarization for the Win

The argument of whether using Bootstrap 5 is necessary is perhaps dependent on the programmer. I recognize some simplicity in using Bootstrap 5 rather than just HTML and CSS. That is because there is the option of standardization that leads to consistency. Which in hand aids in rapid development and responsive design. I found it easier to search for support because it isn’t so saturated with methods that it seems less confusing to find solutions. There are customizations that come ready-made, functional, and provide structure to the formation in achieving a desired look with cross-browser compatibility.

## Do What Makes You Happy

Moving forward I see myself leaning towards the satisfaction that UI design brings to my experience. Though it would be wise to practice knowing all sorts of programming languages. I believe that doing what you love leads to better work. And so I hope to further explore this curiosity in web development, and being able to express creativity with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap 5 so I can continue to express my interest in web development.
