## Watch out for the rabbit hole

Utilizing online resources can offer a bounty of insight, and information to what it is you hope to know. For any
student looking for guidance, or a software developer meeting his wits end on a project. There may be an
existing answer, or others within an online community who are willing to share what they know, or ready to start
a discussion that can provide a possible solution for all to benefit. Because of the saturation of information
in pages and opinions spread across the internet. Searching for answers can make the experience feel like a
clustered and tangled web that leaves you more confused than when you started. Yet there is hope in searching
for what it is you seek to find. Which starts with asking smart questions that can lead to an effective learning
experience.

## Know what you're asking for

Through scrolling submitted questions on stackoverflow.com (an online community whose mission is “Empowering the
world to develop technology through collective knowledge”). I’ve recognized several types of questions
considered favorable, and those that were least considered to be worth the time for a response. Of the (current)
roughly 24 million questions posted on StackOverFlow, questions are voted up, or voted down. Of the less purposeful
questions I pulled to review, some were rapidly receiving negative votes then disappeared from the list, and
Others were marked as closed because they did not categorize as on-topic questions, or needed to be improved.
Which goes to show that fishing for answers without providing adequate detail will not give you the response
you’re looking for. Proving that knowledge is earned through the effort we put in toward understanding it. 

## Work Smarter

Highly voted questions that receive thousands of views stick around on the thread becoming knowledge of the
collective. I’ve noticed that some questions which gain importance are not always most clear at first, yet the
user does provide enough relevant context within the body of their post to describe the question they hope to
enter into discussion. These “smart” questions lead the potential respondents to narrow their effort in hopes of
providing meaningful input. They are open-ended questions with examples of previous work, and diagnostic steps
made in effort to define and solve the problem. An example of this is from a user who had asked to understand
“use strict;” in JavaScript after receiving an error within a program. Though the question wasn’t to directly
find a solution, which the user was able to do, yet it was to find an explanation of the purpose of the
statement after not being able to find sufficient information about it online. The development of the post
enabled other users to provide direct answers to help with recognizing that the “use strict;” can be utilized
for throwing exceptions. Aside from providing solutions, productive communication within an online community can
be helpful in understanding programming languages at different levels as students, and developers progress in
their learning and career.
