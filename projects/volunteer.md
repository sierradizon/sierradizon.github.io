summary: "Preserving Hawaii's Native Plants and Environment"
---

An accumulation of many projects are summed together within this post as events that I became involved in. Sharing the common goal
of restoring a local environment, and perpetuating the native plant population in Hawaii. Work would begin in the earlier part of
the day to avoid heat exhaustion, and to make the most of the day, continuing our work after a lunch break. Depending on what the
day’s mission was, most often it would involve clearing invasive species from the target area. With gloves on, shovels or rakes in
hand, along with our man-power, we would work as a team moving through sections of the forest or wetland. Piling up non-native plant
species to be removed from the site. Other days we would return with plants native to Hawaii such as ‘Ohia Lehua trees that had been
sprouted from seeds, and cared for to grow big enough. Having formed roots, ready for us to plant, we would restore the area we
previously cleared to create this new home environment.

Working together within a community of native-plant enthusiasts influenced our love for what we were doing, and why we do it. We
recognize the importance of maintaining the native forest, waterways, and coastlines. There are native animal species as well as
insects that rely on native plants to survive. Providing a local landscape is supportive of creating a healthy, balanced, and
harmonious environment of native plants and animals in Hawaii. Further encouraging a sustainable land, improving the watershed, and
in preventing erosion or disruption that which non-native plants cause.
