summary: "Design and Construction of Customized Bridal Wear"
---

Much of my sewing career involved designing, creating, or altering to customize bridal dresses. I’ve had the opportunity to work for many brides on Kauai, making their ideas come to life for their wedding day. My process would begin with an initial consultation. Where I would get to know the client and take notes on their ideas, and concerns. I would share with them fabric samples to further express the vision of how the dress would feel, and flow. Rough sketches were made, and fabric orders placed after taking body measurements. 
	It would take about a month of planning and preparation. Typically construction began with muslin to develop patterns and a mock-dress fit to the bride. Once the design was confirmed, and material acquired, I would begin the production process. At least 2-3 fittings are required before finalizing the dress. The time to create a garment would take me at least a few months, yet there were rushed orders taken if I were able to accommodate that request in time. Before having the bride pick up the order, I would have a final look through the entire garment to secure seams and details, and press the material.
	Designing and constructing custom dresses has been one of my most challenging and cherished experiences. Working through last minute alterations to design ideas, and sometimes changes in the bride's measurements could become difficult. Yet in the end, the joy of fulfilling a bride's wishes surpassed the stress. I’ve learned to be innovative with design to satisfy fit and fashion. Being able to challenge my skills, and create connections made this career incredibly enjoyable for me. Pushing me to realize just how much I am capable of, and what I can get done.
